inferno-ds: Native Inferno Kernel for the Nintendo DS 

INTRO
-----
The port [1] is starting to be usable,
that means that limbo programs (dis code) runs on Inferno's Dis VM [2].

Some of the hardware bits [3] that are working are:
	- both lcd screens (including the touch).
	- access to spi devices (arm7): touch, rtc, firmware, power, mic, ...
	- mpu and caches are working.
	- fifos for processor communication between arm7 and arm9.
	- audio support (play and record).

Still the port is far from finished, so the port is a WIP
(work in progress) thing some of the bits missing are:
	- sd card storage 
	- wifi networking

USAGE
-----
To setup/build your own i$CONF.nds file follow the INSTALL file.
After build launch the resulting i$CONF.nds file on your DS.

At boot time it prompts for the source location of the root fs,
choose your selection using the direction keys on your DS.
Currently the only usable option is `root from: kernel'
after the prompt, a window manager wm(1) instance is started
to interact/launch/control programs using a menu-like interface.
